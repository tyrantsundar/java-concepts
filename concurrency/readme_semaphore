Q1: What is a Semaphore, and how is it different from a Mutex?
Answer:
    i) . A Semaphore is used to limit the number of threads accessing a resource at the same time.
    ii). A Mutex allows only one thread at a time, whereas a Semaphore allows multiple threads
        (up to a defined limit).

Q2: Write a Java program where only 3 threads can access a resource at the same time using a Semaphore.
