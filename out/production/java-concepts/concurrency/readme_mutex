Q1: What is a Mutex? How is it different from a Lock?
Answer:
A Mutex (Mutual Exclusion) is a mechanism used to prevent multiple threads
from accessing a shared resource simultaneously.
Lock vs. Mutex:
    1. A Mutex is a type of lock but can only be acquired and released by the same thread.
    2. A Lock (like ReentrantLock in Java) provides more flexibility, such as try-locking,
       timed-locking, and fairness policies.

Q2: Implement a simple counter using a Mutex in Java.
